# 4c - Modify insertion sort to sorts a list of strings instead of numbers. It shouldn't return anything.
# The sorting should ignore case. For example "Zebra" should come after "apple", "maRker" should come after "marble", etc.
# Name this function string_sort. The resulting list should contain the exact same strings as the original list, but in sorted order.
